## 1.1.3: Norms are open-source.

1.1.3.1: Everyone may use norms anywhere without giving credit.

1.1.3.2: Everyone may modify norms any way they please, unless the rules of a building team require these norms to be followed, in which case this is subject to discussion.

1.1.3.3: We try to implement agreed norms by build team corporations. These can be not open source. In this case we only link such norms for convenience of the user.
