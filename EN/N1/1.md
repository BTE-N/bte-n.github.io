# N1.1: How BTEN Works

BTEN, short for *Build The Earth: Normalisation* works as follows:

***

## 1.1.1: Every Norm has its own pages.    

1.1.1.1: N#_EN for the English version, N#_DE for the German variant. # Stands for the Norm Index Number.    

1.1.1.2: Each page features a basic description of the norm, when it is used, and examples (images, schematics) to use the norms in the game. Images and schematics are preferably hosted on discord CDN.

1.1.1.3: Each page may feature its submitter or creator (giving credit) as well as any contributors. 

***

## 1.1.2: Users may submit norms in any area they see fit.

1.1.2.1: Submissions should be detailed and provide as much information as possible.

1.1.2.2: Submissions will be reviewed by a person from the Normalisation committee and will be added by said person if appropriate.

***

## 1.1.3: Norms are open-source.

1.1.3.1: Everyone may use norms anywhere without giving credit.

1.1.3.2: Everyone may modify norms any way they please, unless the rules of a building team require these norms to be followed, in which case this is subject to discussion.
