## 4.1.2.1:  Country flags

A collection of country flags can be found at spawn and can be copied with the help of Worldedit. They can be found as a single banner as well as a 2*3 flag with a flagpole. This flagpole is 7 blocks high, consists of cobblestone walls and is finished by a Playerhead:

**Flagpole**:
```
/give @p skull 1 3 {display:{LocName:"Orb (golden)"},SkullOwner:{Id:"b7785e4e-f190-4a76-9b4d-2d821e3e0564",Properties:{textures:[{Value:"eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvNDUyZGNhNjhjOGY4YWY1MzNmYjczN2ZhZWVhY2JlNzE3Yjk2ODc2N2ZjMTg4MjRkYzJkMzdhYzc4OWZjNzcifX19"}]}}}
