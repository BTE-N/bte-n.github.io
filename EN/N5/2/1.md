# N5.2.1: Standard parking lot

This Norm is showing how to easily construct an angled parking lot. <br>
Note: This is more a tutorial than a norm, even though it contains some guidelines.

## 5.2.1.1: Guidelines

Parking lots are usually 2-3 meters wide, which is also making them usable with Minecraft cars and busses. Between parking lot spots there is a one-block-wide line seperating the spots, if there is a line in real life. <br>
You can use any block you want; I've used:
* **gray concrete powder** as road on private properties (252:7)
* **light gray concrete** as parking spots (251:8)
* **light gray concrete powder** as lines (252:8)

## 5.2.1.2: How to build a parking lot quickly

My example parking lot is featuring quite large parking spots, so this might not be accurate for your parking lot. See the already built one in image 7 for a more common parking lot size.

* Define the area you're building in (Instruction image 1).
* Mark out where the parking spots and where the road is gonna be (Instruction image 2).
* Connect the marks using `//line <id>` (Instruction image 3).
* Remove all the grass inbetween using eg //remove grass in a selection (can be a hassle) and fill the spots with `//fill <id>` (Instruction image 4).
* Draw lines using `//line <id>` with the block you chose for the lines, going across the parking lot. Make sure the distance is always the same (Instruction image 5).
* Finish drawing the lines and erase the ones on the road with either `//set 0`, `//remove <id>` or just by hand (Instruction image 6).
* Fill the road with `//fill <id>` (Instruction image 7).
