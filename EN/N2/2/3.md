# N2.2.3: High-Speed Rails

This is for the high-speed railway track.

{{ site.examples_EN }}

## 2.2.3.1: Railway
To build a 2m long track, proceed as follows:
* Place five smooth stone-blocks(ID 43:8) in a row (instructional image 1)
* To one side of them, place a random mixture of gravel, andesite and cobblestone (instructional image 2)
* On the 2. and 4. block of both rows place an anvil (instructional image 3)
* Place a smooth stone-slab on all left smooth stone-blocks (instructional image 4)
This structure can be repeated until the required length is acquired. Note, that you might need to offset the rows to simulate bends and curves. Examples for this can be found at the Spawn of the BTE DE Server.
