## 2.2.2.1: Railways

To build a 2m long piece of track, follow these steps:
* Place five spruce planks in a row (instructional image 1)
* To one side of them, place a random mixture of gravel, andesite and cobblestone (instructional image 2)
* On the 2. and 4. block of both rows place an anvil (instructional image 3)
* Place a spruce slab on all left spruce planks (instructional image 4)

This structure can be repeated until the required length is acquired. Note, that you might need to offset the rows to simulate bends and curves. Examples for this can be found at the Spawn of the BTE DE Server.
