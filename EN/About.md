## Who are we?

The *Normalisation Project* team is a growing group of people dedicated to creating a set of guidelines when working in the Build The Earth project, started in early 2020.    
It aims to provide resources for building repeating structures, as well as help people wondering "so, how do I build this?" when looking at a street, railway, or other infrastructure.

## Philosophy

The *BTEN* wiki is based on total collaboration, where people from all areas and knowledge fields contribute depending on their abilities and interests.    
Everyone can work on any document if they choose to, and the project is mostly based on trust basis, although we have a team overseeing the process to ensure things are steering in the right direction.    
It is crucial to communicate frequently and to ensure that decisions are made in everyone's best interest, which sometimes require a vote.

## Contribute

As we are evergrowing, we are very open to accepting new members into the team behind the *Normalisation Project*.    
Be it because you like to contribute using your own experience in worldbuilding, or have time on your hands you want to put to good use to add and update norms, or because you are interested in translating and updating the website into languages you can speak.

If you are interested, you can join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/eXzrZSx) and communicate with the members to establish your interests, and to get you ready for whichever way you are planning on contributing.    
The server is also a platform for discussion and support.
