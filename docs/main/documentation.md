## What is Github?

Starting from the very beginning, eh? No worries! We intend to be welcoming to even the most unfamilliar-to-GitHub people out there - so not knowing what you'll be working with is absolutely no problem!    

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform to collaboratively code (in our case, write) on one project together. Everyone can contribute to the project within their own abilities, in our case mostly which languages they speak and what fields they are interested in. There is no experience with coding needed to manouver the website, and with a little time I'm sure you'll know the site like your own back pocket - and who knows, that might even serve you in your own future!
