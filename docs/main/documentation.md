# Welcome to our friendly how-to & member FAQ section!

Hi! I'm Pxnt.

On this page, I will try my  best to guide you to becoming a contributor of the Norming Project as well as answer any questions you might have now or later about this project.    

In the course of the tutorials presented on this page, you will be creating and editing your own page, which the project lead will take as a welcomed symbol of you taking the time to learn more about GitHub and our project!

### **Recommended: If you want to make sure you don't miss anything and have no awkward occurences further down the road, just read the entire site from top to bottom. This will make sure you are as prepared as you could be on your journey to being a Team Member!**

⚠️ As being able to speak English is generally required as a team member, this page is only available in English.

## What is GitHub?

Starting from the very beginning, eh? No worries! We intend to be welcoming to even the most unfamilliar-to-GitHub people out there - so not knowing what you'll be working with is absolutely no problem!    

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform to collaboratively code (in our case, write) on one project together. Everyone can contribute to the project within their own abilities, in our case mostly which languages they speak and what fields they are interested in. There is no experience with coding needed to manouver the website, and with a little time I'm sure you'll know the site like your own back pocket - and who knows, that might even serve you in your own future!

## Creating an account

Before you can work on anything on GitHub, you'll need an account. If you don't have one already, you can create one right now on the [Sign Up](https://github.com/join) page. We will need to know your username once you decide to join and become team member, as we like to let users skip the per-page verification process and directly submit to the

## Navigating GitHub

There is a slight learning curve involved with moving around on GitHub, so here's some key things you might want to know about using the site. Just follow this tutorial along, I recommend that you open the pages as they are talked about so you can see what I'm talking about.

Generally speaking, projects like ours are presented on GitHub similarly to a folder with files in it. This folder, in our case, is located at [/pxnt/BTEN](https://github.com/pxnt/BTEN). Press the link and take a look! Here, you see a few files and folders already, as well as the README.md, which is in our case used to send confused people straight to the website, as this super secret behind-the-scenes business is only for you and me! Well, and a few other people.

To move around in this file system, you simply press on the file you want to view, or the folder you want to open. Important to note here is that you must always click on the blue filename, located right next to each file icon, instead of the gray text to the right of it, which says things like *modify README* - these would instead send you to a page showing you the most recent change to a specific file, which you usually don't need.

Let's together now go into the [/docs/](https://github.com/pxnt/BTEN/tree/master/docs) folder by pressing on the "docs" name, which is where the website actually lives at. There should now be a long row of folders in front of you, many of which having language codes like "EN" and "DE", others having more self-explanatory names like "main" or "icons". To go back into the parent folder (the folder which this folder is in), you can always click on the ".." which are at the top of the file list.

To create new files, you simply press the "Create new file" button located at the top right of any folder page. This doesn't even need to be at the folder you want to place the file in, just make sure you're not somewhere completely elsewhere, as you can only go deeper into the filesystem using the name. Go ahead, press that button now!

On the [file creation page](https://github.com/pxnt/BTEN/new/master/docs), you will now see a huge empty space waiting to be written into. Additionally, you see a small box at the top asking you to name your file. If you are in the wrong folder, you can simply add the names of the subfolder into this text box. This is also how you create new folders, by simply adding the new folder name into the text box, followed by a `/`, and then your file name.

Let's try creating a file. You should still be looking at the file creation page, and the text before the name box should be `BTEN/docs/`. Into the box, type `spam/`. The text should have now moved outside of the box, and instead added itself to the folders to its left! Magic, right?

To create your file, let's give it an actual name! How about your GitHub or Discord username and the current date? For me, this would be `Pxnt-11052020`. Enter your version of this, and don't forget to add the file extension! As our website generator reads *Markdown* files, we need to make sure all of our files are markdown. Make yours one of the team by adding `.md` to the end!

You can now enter anything you like into the body of the file. If you don't know how to work with markdown, just keep reading after this article and you'll learn in no time!

Once you're finished, 

⚠️ You have just been shown how to create a test file. Please do not create random files elsewhere, but . This is considered griefing and will cause you to receive a warning, and a removal from the project if done repeatedly.
