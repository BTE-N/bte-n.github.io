## What is GitHub?

Starting from the very beginning, eh? No worries! We intend to be welcoming to even the most unfamilliar-to-GitHub people out there - so not knowing what you'll be working with is absolutely no problem!    

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform to collaboratively code (in our case, write) on one project together. Everyone can contribute to the project within their own abilities, in our case mostly which languages they speak and what fields they are interested in. There is no experience with coding needed to manouver the website, and with a little time I'm sure you'll know the site like your own back pocket - and who knows, that might even serve you in your own future!

## Navigating GitHub

There is a slight learning curve involved with moving around on GitHub, so here's some key things you might want to know about using the site. Just follow this tutorial along, I recommend that you open the pages as they are talked about so you can see what I'm talking about.

Generally speaking, projects like ours are presented on GitHub similarly to a folder with files in it. This folder, in our case, is located at [/pxnt/BTEN](https://github.com/pxnt/BTEN). Here, you see a few files and folders already, as well as the README.md, which is in our case used to send confused people straight to the website, as this super secret behind-the-scenes business is only for you and me! Well, and a few other people.

To move around in this file system, you simply press on the file you want to view, or the folder you want to open. Important to note here is that you must always click on the blue filename, located right next to each file icon, instead of the gray text to the right of it, which says things like *modify README* - these would instead send you to a page showing you the most recent change to a specific file, which you usually don't need.

Let's together now go into the [/docs/](https://github.com/pxnt/BTEN/tree/master/docs) folder by pressing on the "docs" name, which is where the website actually lives at. There should now be a long row of folders in front of you, many of which having language codes like "EN" and "DE", others having more self-explanatory names like "main" or "icons". To go back into the parent folder (the folder which this folder is in), you can always click on the ".." which are at the top of the file list.

To create new files, you simply press the "Create new file" button located at the top right of any folder page. This doesn't even need to be at the folder you want to place the file in, just make sure you're not somewhere completely elsewhere, as you can only go deeper into the filesystem using the name. Go ahead, press that button now!

On the [file creation page](https://github.com/pxnt/BTEN/new/master/docs), you will now see a huge empty space waiting to be written into. Additionally, you see a small box at the top asking you to name your file. If you are in the wrong
